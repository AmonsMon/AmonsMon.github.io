Xiaokang Liu, associate professor and master's supervisor of the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, received his Ph.D. in control science and engineering in 2019, and is engaged in theoretical and applied research on collaborative control, including hybrid cooperative control of multi-agent systems, cooperative control and optimization of microgrid systems, etc. He has published more than 30 Automatica and IEEE Transactions, authorized 10 national invention patents, and has been selected as 4 ESI highly cited papers. He has presided over the general projects and youth projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the youth projects of the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, and the professional education and teaching reform research projects of the Steering Committee for the Teaching of Automation Majors in Colleges and Universities of the Ministry of Education.

* Research issues of personal interest: 
1. Braess's Paradox phenomenon: Will Braess's Paradox phenomenon occur when the power system is networked? 
2. Coupled power flow optimization: How to solve the optimization problem with PDE constraints of gas network? 
3. DC power flow control: Under what conditions can positive stability still be guaranteed after rank-one disturbance of the positive stability matrix?

Like-minded students are welcome!

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
